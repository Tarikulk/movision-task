### Description : This is a movie website. Here are it's all information >

#### 1. At the top of the website it has navbar with 4 navigation bar. NOTE: (These navigation bars are for decoration only this is why it is linked to home page)

#### 2. After the navbar, I have added a responsive carousel using a "react-responsive-carousel" and have fetched all images and some information from the IMDB API which are showing in the carousel.

#### 3. After the carousel, I implemented Search Functionality. Using the search bar I can search for movies that are shown below. 

#### 4. After the search bar, I fetched data from IMDB api and I showed the data in Card. I have also linked dynamically the card with the details page. If anyone clicks on the card they will redirect to that's card detail page. 

#### 5. On the details page, I have shown more details of that movie card that has been clicked. 

#### 6. At the bottom of the website, I have implemented Pagination and per page, it will display 10 cards. 

#### 7. And also I have added many CSS animations and the website is responsive.
